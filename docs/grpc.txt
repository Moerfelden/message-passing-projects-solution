gRPC
====
My service location-grpc is listening on nodeport 30004.
It allows an external client, e.g. a mobile application, not only to retrieve a location by id, but also to create a new location.
The proto file is available via the following path: /modules/location-grpc/location.proto.

A Python script, called location-grpc-tester.py, serves as a sample gRPC client.
It can be used to test location retrieval and location creation.

Usage instructions:
- Install grpcio and protobuf if you have not already done so.
- Move to folder modules/location-grpc/app.
- Run this command: python3 location-grpc-tester.py
